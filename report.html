        <p>
            Alex Schilke<br /><br />
            Information:<br /> Cats, cats, and more cats!!! This website has a great deal of information on cats with more than 40 breeds including all varieties from hairless to absolute walking furballs. There is no shortage of available cute pictures either. Each breed has a convenient image to go along with the description. A very nice touch is the pronunciation guide next to the name of each breed.
            <br /><br />
            Style: <br />The style is consistent and flows nicely with nothing too flashy or overwhelming thrown at you. The color scheme really draws your attention to the most important information on each page, the cats obviously! When opening up the home page it gives you a nice introduction in to what kind of information the website is trying to convey and gives you a glimpse into the style and layout of each page. Big fan of the logo. The style fits very well on both a computer and mobile device.
            <br /><br />
            Features: <br />The tab on the top of your webpage changes as you switch from page to page which makes it easy for you to recognize which page you’re on, in case you get lost in the cats. The contact us page is easy to use and straightforward. The website is dynamic and changes appropriately with the size of the browser and works very smoothly on both the computer and mobile devices. The animation on the submit button is a fantastic touch!
            <br /><br />
            Issues: <br />You can enter an email with only an @ symbol, and also enter a message and send it in without a first or last name.
        </p>
        
            <h1>Content</h1>
        <p>
            Is the content original, not placeholder text or copy lifted from elsewhere?<br />
            Yes, I compiled information from many sources to find out a large selection of cat breeds and coat length. I also gathered behaviors and colors for each individual breed.
            <br /><br />
            Does the site incorporate a form element?<br />
            Yes, if going from the home page, when the "Contact Us" Cat logo is clicked, it takes you to a form to fill out and message the admins of the website.
            <br /><br />
            Does the site include links to other sites?<br />
            Yes, there are 3 links provided at the bottom of the home page to 3 other websites with cat breed information.
            <br /><br />
            Are there the required five separate pages?<br />
            Yes, there is the home page, short hair breeds page, medium hair breeds page, long hair breeds page, no hair breeds page, and contact us page giving a grand total of 6 pages total.
            <br /><br />
            Does the page include a favicon?<br />
            Yes, it has a cat.
            <br /><br />
            Does the page include an animation?<br />
            Yes, the contact us page when the submit button is clicked and all information is filled in correctly, the button will spin 360 degrees and a "message sent successfully" message pops up.
            <br /><br />
            </p>
            <h1>Coherence and Contrast</h1>
        <p>
            Are the images appropriate to the theme?<br />
            Yes, all photos are of cats or the cat themed logos to represent the website.
            <br /><br />
            Are the images appropriately sized?<br />
            Yes, all photos are sized to be the same widths on the page and to be within the boxes they belong to.
            <br /><br />
            Are there strong axes of alignment?<br />
            Yes. Most are centered and if not, they are pushed to an end.
            <br /><br />
            Is your style maintained across pages?<br />
            Yes, each page has the same heading and navigation at the top, and each breed page has the same formatting with showing each breed.
            <br /><br />
            Is the spacing clean?<br />
            Yes, I went through and made sure there is at least 10px between each new element.
            <br /><br />
            Does the site include different fonts?<br />
            Yes, 'Spartan' and 'Lobster Two'.
            </p>
        <h1>
            Client-mindedness</h1>
        <p>
            Is the site designed with the client in mind rather than the designer?<br />
            The goal was to make an informational cat site showing all different types of cats. I think Cat-ipedia made that come to life.
            <br /><br />
            Does your site appear appropriately on both mobile and desktop screens?<br />
            Yes, I even tested it on my iPhone 11 Pro Max. The navigation goes from a row into a column and the font-sizes get bigger when going from desktop to mobile.
            <br /><br />
            Is your site arranged in a navigable way?<br />
            Yes, you are able to reach any page from any page through the navigation panel or the logos at the top of the screen.
            <br /><br />
            Are images made accessible with alt attributes?<br />
            Yes, each image, even logos, say what they are in the alt attribute.
            <br /><br />
            Does the client report provide meaningful feedback?<br />
            Yes, the client mentioned issues with the form on the contact us page accepting criteria that shouldn't be accepted.
            </p>
        <h1>
            Project Organization</h1>
            <p>Are external CSS files used?<br />
            Yes, I have one for all pages so I am able to keep consistent formatting across all pages. It's called general.css because of that.
        <br /><br />
            Is the site organized into folders as specified?<br />
            Yes, the images are all placed in the images folder.
        <br /><br />
            Are classes and IDs used appropriately to apply styles at the right level of granularity?<br />
            Yes, the scenarios that need special treatment in comparison to the generic scenarios have IDs versus classes.
        <br /><br />
            Are selectors used appropriately?<br />
            Yes, each item is called appropriately because I'm able to change specific classes based on elements having IDs.
        </p>
        <h1>
            Technical Soundness</h1>
        <p>
            Are lowercase filenames used?<br />
            Yes, everything is lowercase.
            <br /><br />
            Is the site served over HTTPS on port 8443?<br />
            Yes, it has a secure connection on port 8443.
            <br /><br />
            Is the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript readable?<br />
            Yes, I took extra steps to clean it up and give everything comprehensive names.
            <br /><br />
            Does your HTML and CSS pass all validation?<br />
            Yes, I ran it against both the HTML Validator and CSS Validator. I included the CSS Validator graphic at the bottom of each page.
            <br />
            Is the site created without the aid of other libraries or frameworks?<br />
            Yes, the site is created soley with html, css, and javascript.
            <br /><br />
            Was there a steady flow of commits to Git?<br />
