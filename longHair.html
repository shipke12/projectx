        <h1>Why would you want a long-haired cat?</h1>
        <p>
            The long-haired cat is everything you need and more as a cat enthusiast! The massive plush of their long fur only brings you closer with your cat during daily grooming, cuddles, and fur EVERYWHERE!
            <br />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Like cuddling with a teddy bear!</li>
            <li>They're way cuter when they play</li>
            <li>Time to spend with your cat daily</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <br />
            However, long-haired cats are not great for humans with allergies because they are the the epicenter for pet dander and loose fur. If you don't have a lot of time to dedicate to grooming your cat, long-haired cats may not be for you.'
