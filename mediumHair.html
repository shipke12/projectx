        <h1>Why would you want a medium-haired cat?</h1>
        <p>
            Medium-haired cats can give you the fluffy plush fur that you crave without the tedious daily grooming of long-haired cats!
            <br />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fluffy cuddle buddy!</li>
            <li>Brushing only sometimes!</li>
            <li>They have more fur than the short-haired!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <br />
            However, if you have an allergy to cats, it's best you stay away from medium-haired cats. They are a slippery slope to long-haired cats in terms of pet dander and fur!
