        <h1>Why would you want a short-haired cat?</h1>
        <p>
            The short-haired cat is a great companion for those who don't have much time to brush out lots of fur! Some of these cats are also hypoallergenic as well.
            <br />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Great for allergies</li>
            <li>Less vacuuming!</li>
            <li>Less brushing</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <br />
            However, fur is still going to be shed and depending on the cat, there could be a LOT of shedding. Keep that in mind when seeking a new companion!
